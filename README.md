## KEY INSIGHTS
After an in-depth analysis, the following insights were revealed by the data.
  - Breast cancer rarely affect women below the age of 30.
  - The most vulnerable age group of breast cancer is between 50 - 60 years old.
  - Majority of the patients belong to the early-stage primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma (T1N0M0) cancer stage, which signifies the chances of the patients having an early breast cancer test.
  - 61.89% of the patients fall under cancer grade II, while only 29.96% of them fall under cancer grade III, the 32% reduction of patients from cancer grade II to cancer grade III signifies a posible positive response to breast cancer treatments.
  - There is a positive correlations between cancer grade and stage, birads and stage, while a  negative correlations were also observed between age and cancer stage, grade and breast density.
